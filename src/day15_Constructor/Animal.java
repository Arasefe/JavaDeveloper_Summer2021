		 	1) this() is used for constructor call

		 	3) In a constructor, how many times can "this()" be used? 
		 	   Answer: At most once. Because this() must be in the first line, if you use 
		 	           more than once where will you put it? You need to put it into second, third, .. etc
		 	           lines but it is not allowed.
		 	           
		 	What is the difference between "this()" and "this"?           
		 	1)"this()" is used for constructor call, "this" is used for variable call.          
		 	2)"this()" can be used just once, "this" can be used many times.
